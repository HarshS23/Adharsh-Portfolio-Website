\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Hello there! I\'92m a Computer Science student at the University of Alberta with a strong passion for building software and understanding how systems work under the hood. My studies focus on algorithms, operating systems, and software engineering, and I enjoy turning theory into practice through projects like developing a 3D rendering engine in C and building collaborative Android applications using modern backend tools. I\'92m especially interested in systems programming, graphics, and writing clean, well-structured code that scales and remains maintainable. Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and continuously pushing myself through personal projects and technical challenges. Have a look at my projects, and don\'92t hesitate to reach out with any questions! }
