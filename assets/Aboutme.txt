Hello there! I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Alberta with a strong passion for building software and understanding how systems work under the hood. My studies focus on algorithms, operating systems, software engineering, and Machine Leaning. I enjoy turning theory into practice through projects like developing a 3D rendering engine in C and building collaborative Android applications using modern backend tools. I’m especially interested in systems programming, graphics, and writing clean, well-structured code that scales and remains maintainable. Outside of academics, I enjoy weightlifting, cooking, Basketball, and as well as developing projects with new technologies and pushing myself through personal challenges. Have a look at my projects, and don't hesitate to suggest any changes or to reach out with any questions!
